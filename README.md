# homemade-google-hard
You liked it easy, now we're going to do it hard! The hard version of my repo [homemade-google-easy](https://github.com/GibsonT/homemade-google-easy).

This is the optional 'Difficult' portion of the HTML/CSS project for Project Odin; specifically, the project [found here](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css).

* [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com)
* [TOP's Curriculum GitHub](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/curriculum)

A couple things to note for this project that I'm not too happy with:
* The results navigation is just a picture, not actual links with Google lettering on top.
  This is more out of laziness than anything else.

* The CSS in this project is BAD. Like, I could vomit into the my toilet, wait a few minutes,
  then go retrieve it from my local pumping station (or where ever it ends up)
  and it would probably look better than the CSS for this project. About half way
  through, I noticed how bad it was getting and decided to just roll with it for
  time's sake, rather than refactor it. I'm going to be taking steps to help
  avoid the CSS explosion in the future.

Otherwise, I'm pretty happy with how this turned out!
